# Spiky_Topman_Battle
Makes spiky topman boss battle .kmp for Mario Kart Wii
Given a file course.kmp containing galaxy arena, with no topmen or topman managers, adds a specified number of topmen and managers to create any topman boss battle. However, because the topman manager settings are not fully known, this program does not always work. The specific problem setting is setting 5 on the topman manager. Also contains KMPObject, Begoman, and Manager classes to abstract some functionality.
